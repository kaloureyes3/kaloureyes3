- 👋 Hi, I’m @kaloureyes3
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Data Engineering, Trading and programming languages. I am mainly foccused on learning SQL and Python first. Later, I would like to learn some Java and C++ where I do have already some knowledge reading, interpreting and debuggind legacy code at my current company.

- 💞️ Right now I am working as a Business Analyst for Product & Price where I collaborate closely with C++ and Java developers to improve current applications, services and the Trading System, while at the same time we are building new ones. Besides, working on the integration for the future integration of the price feed and referenca data sourcing information between flatex and Degiro.
